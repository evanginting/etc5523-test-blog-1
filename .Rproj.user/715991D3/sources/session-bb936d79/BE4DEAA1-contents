## Penguins Dataset

In this analysis, we will try to unveil the relationship between body mass and flipper length of penguins. Do heavier the penguins have longer flipper? Let's find out!

Here is all the libraries that we are going to use in this analysis.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

Here is the preview of the dataset:

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

Let see the correlation between body mass and flipper length.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g,
                     y = flipper_length_mm,
                     colour = sex)) +
         geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Correlation between Flipper Length vs Body Mass") +
  xlab("Flipper Length (mm)") +
  ylab("Body Mass (gram)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

From the plot above, seems like there is positive relation between body mass and flipper length.
